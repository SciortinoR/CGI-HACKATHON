

Wirelessly Controlled Gimbal: Have two STM32F4 boards wirelessly communicate in order for one
board to control the orientation of the other using the MEMS accelerometer. Programmed in embedded C
and ARM.
Autonomous Robot: Programmed and designed a Lego Mindstorms robot capable of competing
against other robots in a game of “basketball”. Functionality was coded using Java along with the Eclipse IDE.
Music Box: Created a functional music player using VHDL programming on an Altera DE1 circuit board.
